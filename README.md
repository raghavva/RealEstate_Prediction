# RealEstate_Prediction
Implemented a Random Forest Regressor for price prediction with feature importance analysis and data visualization to interpret model results.

Developed a Random Forest Regressor for Price Prediction:

Built a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to predict prices based on multiple features.
Utilized feature importance analysis to identify the most influential factors affecting the predictions.
Performed Feature Engineering and Data Visualization:

Conducted feature importance analysis to rank and visualize the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.
Used libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to create insightful visualizations, such as bar plots, to interpret model results.
End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline:

Designed and implemented an end-to-end pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
Ensured the pipeline was scalable and reusable for similar regression tasks.
Leveraged Advanced Machine Learning Techniques:

Applied hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation techniques to optimize the Random Forest Regressor for better accuracy and performance.
Focused on explainability by analyzing feature importance to make the model's predictions interpretable.
